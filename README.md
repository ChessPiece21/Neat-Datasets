# Neat Datasets
Because sometimes you just wanna play with neat datasets. 
<br>
Inspired by my research mentor and former instructor [Melanie Walsh](https://melaniewalsh.org/)'s [repository of the same name](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/Neat-Datasets).

**Index:**
<br>
- Danganronpa.csv is created by me. It contains information about the cast of characters from Chunsoft's *[Danganronpa]*(https://danganronpa.us/) mystery video game series. It includes both official information like their heights and weights in the game and unofficial information like their fan-created MBTI and Enneagram profiles from [The Personality Database](https://www.personality-database.com/). 
- Pokemon.csv includes information of all Pokemon from Gens 1-7 taken from [Pokemon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/).
- Seattle-Libraries.csv and Seattle-Cultural-Spaces.csv are from the City of Seattle [Open Data Portal](https://data.seattle.gov/).
