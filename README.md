# Neat Datasets
Because sometimes you just wanna play with neat datasets. 
<br>
Inspired by my research mentor and former instructor [Dr. Melanie Walsh](https://melaniewalsh.org/)'s [repository of the same name](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/Neat-Datasets).

**Index:**
<br>
- **Danganronpa.csv** is created by me. It contains information about the cast of characters from Chunsoft's *[Danganronpa](https://danganronpa.us/)* mystery video game series. It includes both official information like their heights and weights in the game and unofficial information like their fan-created MBTI and Enneagram profiles from [The Personality Database](https://www.personality-database.com/). 
- **Pokemon.csv** includes information of all Pokemon from Gens 1-7 taken from [Pokemon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/).
- **Seattle-Churches.csv** is a dataset I created that includes information about all the Catholic churches in Seattle, WA. It is web-scraped from [the Archdiocese of Seattle's parish finder](https://archseattle.org/parish-finder/). You can also find this on [my Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chesspiece99/archdiocese-of-seattle-churches).
- **Seattle-Libraries.csv** and **Seattle-Cultural-Spaces.csv** are from the City of Seattle [Open Data Portal](https://data.seattle.gov/).
