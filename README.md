# Neat Datasets
Because sometimes you just wanna play with neat datasets. 
<br>
Inspired by my research mentor and former instructor [Melanie Walsh](https://melaniewalsh.org/)'s [repository of the same name](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/Neat-Datasets).

**Index:**
<br>
- pokemon.csv includes information of all Pokemon from Gens 1-7 taken from [Pokemon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/).
<br>
- Seattle-Libraries.csv and Seattle-Cultural-Spaces.csv are from the [City of Seattle's Open Data Portal](https://data.seattle.gov/).
